### Software

There are countless software systems available and in use in the construction design industry, which at a high-level can be categorized into three key practices; architecture, structural engineering, and HVAC. The below three are a minimal example of the systems involved in a project. Each represents the most commonly used solution in the respective field. 

**ARCHITECTURE:** [Revit](https://www.autodesk.com/products/revit/overview) | [API docs](https://www.revitapidocs.com/)

**STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING:** [Tekla](https://www.tekla.com/) | [API docs](https://developer.tekla.com/tekla-structures/documentation)

**HVAC:** [MagiCAD](https://www.magicad.com) | [docs](https://portal.magicad.com/Download/GetProductCategoryList?categoryId=4)

These softwares are all on the rather small list of softwares with the [IFC2x3 Step 2 Certification](http://www.ifcwiki.org/index.php/IFC_Certified_Software). At the moment and going to the future, [IFC4 Certification](https://www.buildingsmart.org/ifc4-software-certification-delivers-first-milestone/) is the one to watch, but at the moment just one company is certified. 

One more class of software to be included here is analysis solutions. Examples include:

### Considerations for Software 

- Market Share
- API eco-system
- API documentation
- IFC Certification
